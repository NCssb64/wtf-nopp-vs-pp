# Waterfall Format: Placement Pools vs No-PP

PP and NoPP are variants of the "WaterFall Tournament Format" (WTF). There have been debates about this all over twitter, facebook, and elsewhere for a year or so. This is an attempt at an objective summary of the points people are making.

## Overview of WTF

There is a lot of flexibility to the WTF tournament, so I'll start with a basic outline before getting into detail.

1. A waterfall tournament consists of several divisions, and each division has a bunch of pools of players.
2. The idea of waterfall is that the lowest division of pools all compete, then some number of the highest finishing players in each pool advance to the next highest division.
3. This continues until the final division (Division 1), where the advancing players get put into a bracket.

That's the basic idea. Here are the flexible details:

* the number of divisions and the size of pools in divisions can vary; 64 events have had pools of size between 4 and 8, with anywhere between 3 and 5 divisions, but this could change.
* the format of pool play can be whatever the TO wants; most 64 events have used round robin pools.
* pools can have any number of the top finishing players advance; most 64 events have had the top 2 finishers of each pool advance.
* the format and size of the final bracket are flexible; 64 events have all (I think) been double elimination, with sizes ranging from top 32 to top 8.

As an example, **Super Smash Con 2017**
* 256 players
* Used placement pools and 3 divisions, with cut to top 32 for bracket.
* Placement pools and divisions were all round robin.
* Placement pools had size 5-6
* Players finishing in the bottom of PPs were placed into a separate "Amateur Bracket".
* Div 3 pools were size 6
* Div 2 and Div 1 pools were size 5.

This brings up one more point of flexibility:
* TOs can use a preliminary round of pools (called Placement Pools, or "PP" ) and use the results of PPs to sift players into the divisions based on PP results, or even place some players into a separate Amateur Bracket (though this has been uncommon in 64 events so far.)
* Or, TOs can simply seed players directly into divisions (this format is called NoPP).

People in the community have been debating pros and cons of this choice for a while now, so I wanted to collect some of the main arguments in one place.

In my opinion you should not think of this as "there is one right answer" and instead consider that there are actual pros and cons to each, and one format could be better suited to some circumstances than the other format.

As an example, if you have a tournament where basically all players have unknown skill level, then seeding players directly into divisions would be impossible to do accurately, so Placement Pools would be better suited, in my opinion.
On the other hand, if your event is very short on time and you have pretty good seeding information on almost all the players, then NoPP would be better-suited because PPs take a lot of time, and if you have great seeding info, you could reasonably accurately seed players directly into the divisions that PPs would determine anyway.

With that said, here are some of the trade-offs people have argued about in the past.

## Trade-offs between PP and NoPP

### Minimum number of matches each player gets
In a standard PP tournament of large size (like SSC, Keystoned, LetsGo, or Boss Battle), a player who loses every match would get roughly 9-12 matches: ~5-7 in PP and ~4-6 in bottom division before being knocked out of the tournament.
In NoPP, the bottom division would have pools of 9-12 players.

### Skill level of your opponents
With PP, you face players of widely varying skill levels: the bottom 1 seed could be a Melee or Smash 4 player who is there for fun, and the top 1 seed will probably be a world class player. It is likely that only the 2-3 players closest to your seed in the pool will be close matches: the others will crush you or be crushed by you.

With NoPP, the bottom large division will have players closer together in skill level.

### Time constraints
Placement Pools is in addition to the regular divisions, and so requires more matches. One argument holds that removing PP would create a lot of time for additional side events.

### Handling DQs and No shows

### Floating players vs earning your seed
