# Waterfall Format: Placement Pools vs No-PP

PP and NoPP are variants of the "WaterFall Tournament Format" (WTF). There have been debates about this all over twitter, facebook, and elsewhere for a year or so. This is an attempt at an objective summary of the points people are making.

## Overview of WTF
WTF consists of several divisions (3-5 depending on attendance). Each division has round robin pools, and the top finishers of each pool advance to the next level of divisions.

1. Each division consists of pools of size ~4-5. Pools are round robin.
2. The lowest division (Div 5) starts first. The top 2 finishers from each pool advance to Div 4, and the rest of the players are knocked out of the tournament.
3. The rest of the divisions continue in the same way: pools of size ~4-5, round robin, top 2 finishers from each pool advance to the next division.
4. This continues until Div 1. The top 2 finishers in each Div 1 pool advance to bracket. (Bracket size depends on number of attendees. As an example, SSC 2017 (256 players) cut to top 32 while Boss Battle 3 (113 players) cut to top 8.)

### PP
TOs seed players into "Placement Pools": round robin pools of size ~5-7. After PPs are over, all players are placed in a division based on their performance in PP. The rest of the tournament proceeds as described above.

### NoPP
Instead, the TOs seed players directly into the different divisions.
Importantly, the divisions in NoPP are different from PP: the lower divisions are bigger, guaranteeing all players the same minimum number of matches in the tournament, regardless of skill level.

## Differences between PP and NoPP

### Minimum number of matches each player gets
In PP, a player who loses every match would get roughly 11 matches: ~5-7 in PP and ~4-5 in bottom division before being knocked out of the tournament. In NoPP, the bottom division would have pools of 9-12 players.

### Skill level of your opponents
With PP, you face players of widely varying skill levels: the bottom 1 seed could be a Melee or Smash 4 player who is there for fun, and the top 1 seed will probably be a world class player. It is likely that only the 2-3 players closest to your seed in the pool will be close matches: the others will crush you or be crushed by you.

With NoPP, the bottom large division will have players closer together in skill level.
